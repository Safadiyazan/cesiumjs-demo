# Introduction

Project Name: 3D Visualization of modeling multimodal mobility.
Project goal: The project aims to visualize multimodal mobility modeling using the [CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/) solution.
Author: Yazan Safadi

The following documentation aims to describe the possibility of integrating CesiumJS with traffic simulations to visualize agent movement within an urban environment. The information on this website is an example of one approach (which might not be ideal); for official documentation and implementation guidelines, please visit Cesium documentation.

Feel free to reach out for any questions or inquiries. The author would like to thank the Cesium Team for the support and opportunity.
