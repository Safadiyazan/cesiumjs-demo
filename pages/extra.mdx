## Vehicle and Motorcycle Motion with pNEUMA Dataset
This section showcases a preliminary exploration of vehicle and motorcycle motion within the tool. It utilizes the pNEUMA dataset Â© 2020 by E. Barmpounakis and N. Geroliminis (refer to https://open-traffic.epfl.ch/), focusing on traffic data from Athens, Greece taking by drones. Note that this is a work-in-progress demonstration and does not represent the final implementation. The purpose is to illustrate the tool potential for integrating real-world vehicle GPS location data and microsimulation tools like SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility). Future development will focus on incorporating these functionalities for more comprehensive traffic analysis. The included video provides a glimpse into this potential. This expansion of the tool capabilities paves the way for more detailed and realistic simulations of urban mobility scenarios.
